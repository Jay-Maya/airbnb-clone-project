## Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project uses the following technologies to build a modern, scalable web application:

### ðŸ”¹ Django
A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development. In this project, Django is used to build the backend server and RESTful APIs, handle authentication, and manage server-side logic.

### ðŸ”¹ PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system. It is used to store user data, property listings, bookings, and reviews with strong data integrity and query capabilities.

### ðŸ”¹ GraphQL
A query language for APIs. It allows the frontend to request only the specific data it needs from the backend, making data fetching more efficient and flexible.

### ðŸ”¹ HTML & CSS
Standard technologies used for structuring (HTML) and styling (CSS) the frontend of the application.

### ðŸ”¹ JavaScript
The programming language that brings interactivity to the frontend. It is used alongside React for client-side scripting.

### ðŸ”¹ Git & GitHub
Version control tools used to manage and collaborate on the project codebase. Git tracks changes, while GitHub hosts the repository and supports collaboration.

### ðŸ”¹ Docker (Optional)
